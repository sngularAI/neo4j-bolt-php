### About

Fork of no longer maintained [graphaware/neo4j-bolt-php](https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-bolt-php) project.
This fork aims to maintain and update PHP Bolt driver to the newest version (V4). This driver is curently compatible with `graphaware/common` and can be used as drop in replacement to be used in [graphaware/neo4j-php-client](https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-php-client), but eventually it will drop support for it.

### Supported versions

- Bolt V1 for Neo4j 3.0 to Neo4j 3.5
- Bolt V2 for Neo4j 3.4 to Neo4j 3.5
- Bolt V3 for Neo4j 3.5+
- Bolt V4 for Neo4j 4.0+

#### Structures
- `Point2D`
- `Point3D`
- `Duration`
-  `LocalDatetime` and `DateTime` (zoned and offset)
- `Time` and `LocalTime`

- PHP's `\DateInterval` (converts to `Duration`)
